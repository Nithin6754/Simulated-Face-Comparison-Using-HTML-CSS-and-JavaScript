# Simulated-Face-Comparison-Using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript
This project demonstrates a basic simulation of facial recognition using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload two facial images—one labeled as a "known" face and another as a "test" face—and visually compares them in a browser environment. The system doesn’t use any backend or AI model but instead simulates the comparison by checking for similarity in the filenames of the uploaded images. If the test image filename includes the known image name, it displays a simulated match result; otherwise, it shows a no-match notification.

The idea behind this project is to create a lightweight and interactive front-end prototype that mimics the behavior of real facial recognition systems. This makes it a great educational tool or user interface prototype for future integration with real machine learning models using Python libraries such as face_recognition, OpenCV, or deep learning frameworks. The project is entirely client-side and requires no server setup or database.

Technologies used include HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and vanilla JavaScript for logic, file handling, and DOM manipulation. JavaScript’s FileReader API enables real-time image previews, while event-driven logic updates the UI based on user input.

This project is particularly useful for frontend developers, educators, or students who want to explore how facial recognition interfaces might function without diving into complex AI code. It serves as an intuitive and easily extendable base for building real-world facial recognition applications. The simplicity and accessibility of the code make it a great starting point for developing AI-based web interfaces with a strong emphasis on usability and design.
